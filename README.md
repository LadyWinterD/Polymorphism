# Polymorphism

In this programming, the father class is person, so if you print this class, it will show “my name is Bill. The son class is student. It extends the father class, person. When you print the son class, it will show the same answer “ my name is bill.” But after I override the function , the new student will show the answer ( my name is lily) .
